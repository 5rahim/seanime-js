## Caveats

For the time being, users must ensure their AniList watchlist includes all media present in their local library before
initiating the scanning process.
This is because Seanime relies on the user's AniList data to accurately match episode files and organize them
effectively.
Failure to do so may result in incorrect matches, especially when dealing with sequels, prequels, or different seasons
of the same series.

## Development

1. Update `.env` file

```dotenv
# Deploy your Consumet API https://github.com/consumet/api.consumet.org#vercel
CONSUMET_API_URL="https://consumet-api-example.vercel.app"
```

2. Install packages

```shell
npm install
```

3. Enjoy

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Known issues

- :shrug:

## Not planned

- Watch together feature / social features
- Torrent streaming (use [Miru](https://github.com/ThaUnknown/miru/))
- Progress tracking without AniList
- Mobile app

## TODO

- [ ] Move Torrent Search to modal
- [ ] Edit file metadata
- [ ] Show a section with new, un-downloaded episodes
- [ ] Preliminary scan to hydrate AniList (for users without anilist data)
- [ ] Update settings local directory picker
- [ ] Manage/Un-ignore ignored files
- [ ] Optimize episode number normalization during scan with cache (library-entry.ts L171)
- [ ] Offline mode
