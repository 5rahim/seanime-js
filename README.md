## Caveats

For the time being, users must ensure their AniList watchlist includes all media present in their local library before
initiating the scanning process.
This is because Seanime relies on the user's AniList data to accurately match episode files and organize them
effectively.
Failure to do so may result in incorrect matches, especially when dealing with different seasons
of the same series.

## Use

### Self-hosted

Seanime requires a Node.js server to run since it uses Next.js SSR and server actions.
Since Tauri does not bundle Node.js by design, I'm still trying out multiple ways to release a production build with
Node.js embedded.

For now, users with Node.js installed can run Seanime's production build by following these steps:

`Soon`

### Release

`Soon`

## Development

1. Update `.env` file

```dotenv
# Consumet is needed for streaming
# Deploy your Consumet API https://github.com/consumet/api.consumet.org#vercel
CONSUMET_API_URL="https://consumet-api-example.vercel.app"
# Anify is currently used to get better episode covers
ANIFY_API_KEY=""
```

2. Install packages

```shell
npm install
```

3. Run

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Known issues

- Authentication is hit or miss
- :shrug:

## Not planned

- Watch together feature / social features
- Torrent streaming (use [Miru](https://github.com/ThaUnknown/miru/))
- Progress tracking without AniList
- Mobile app

## Future plans

Features that may be implemented

- Manga support
- Auto-download new episodes

## TODO
