## Caveats

For the time being, users must ensure their AniList watchlist includes all media present in their local library before
initiating the scanning process.
This is because Seanime relies on the user's AniList data to accurately match episode files and organize them
effectively.
Failure to do so may result in incorrect matches, especially when dealing with different seasons
of the same series.

## Development

1. Update `.env` file

```dotenv
# Deploy your Consumet API https://github.com/consumet/api.consumet.org#vercel
CONSUMET_API_URL="https://consumet-api-example.vercel.app"
```

2. Install packages

```shell
npm install
```

3. Enjoy

```shell
npm run dev
```
