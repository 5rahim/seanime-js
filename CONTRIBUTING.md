## Contributing

Before opening a PR, you should use the Feature Request or Issue template to announce your idea and get feedback on
whether it's a good fit for the project.

Your contribution should be concise, have a clear scope, be testable, and be well documented. If you're not sure about
something, feel free to ask.

If the scope of your contribution goes beyond simple fixes, you may need to be familiar with the following:
